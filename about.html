        <p>
          Hello there, my name is Juzet Arana. I was born on June 19th, 1999 to Francis J Arana and JJ C Jerome Arana. I have three siblings that I claim, Ah'Shirae Arana born August 25, 1996, Jurii Arana born August 27, 1997, and Ahmoray Arana born February 17, 2001. Together we make the Arana clan with the motto of "All for one, one for all."

        <center><h2>School</h2></center>
        <p>
          I am a sophomore currently attending Pasadena High School. I am taking AP and Honors classes to achieve the highest of my abilities, I am on the honor roll with a 3.5 GPA. I plan on attending NYU or Brown University in the east coast, getting out of California gives me an insight on where I want to begin my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a lot of friends at school but there is one that is my true homegirl, Isabelle Lepesant. I've have known her since the sixth grade and we have been friends ever since, and she plans on going to the east coast for college too, so I hope 20 years from now I can say we've known eachother for along time.

        <center><h2>App Academy</h2></center>
        <p>
          When I was in the eighth grade attendinig Marshall Fundamental, a dude named Dexter came to my class and was advertising the App Academy. The whole time he was talkign all I heard was free wifi which grabbed my attention. Never once in a million year would I think of myself carrying a computer in my bag and making my own website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I stay, my second year in this program, I actually kind of like it, however I don't plan on pursing a career in this subject. It's something I would do for fun or just because.

        <center><h2>DC Trip</h2></center>
        <p>
          So far, I have done a lot for my age I guess you can say. Currently I am one out of 6 students selected to go to an all expense paid for trip to Washington DC in the TRIO PCC Program. This is probabably my greatest accomplishment considering the fact that there are more than 400 kids in the program. This is such an honor to me because I am the only sophomore out of the group and I am probably the best spoken one(not to brag). I am proud of myself and I know I have made my parents truly happy, since I didn't do anything freshman year.
